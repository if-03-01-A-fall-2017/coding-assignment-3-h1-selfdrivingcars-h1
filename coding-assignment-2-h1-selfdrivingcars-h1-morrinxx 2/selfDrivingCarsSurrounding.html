        <h1>Technology</h1>
        <p>Autonomous cars use a variety of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry and computer vision.</p>
        <p>Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify decent navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant traffic signs.</p>
        <p>Autonomous cars must have control systems that are capable of analysing sensory data to distinguish between different cars on the road.</p>
        <p>Modern self-driving cars generally use Bayesian Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, which fuse data from multiple sensors
        <p>and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates.</p>
        <p>SLAM with Detection and Tracking of other Moving Objects (DATMO) like cars and pedestrians is a variant being developed by Google.</p>
        <p>Simpler systems may use roadside Real-Time Locating System (RTLS) beacon systems to aid localisation.</p>
        <p>Typical sensors include stereo vision, GPS and IMU. Visual object recognition uses machine vision including neural networks.</p>
