      <h1>What are autonomous cars?</h1>
      <p>A car which can navigate, scan its surrounding and drive without any human input is called an autonomous car, also known as driverless, self-driving or robotic car.</p>
      <p>In 2017 no cars had a permission to drive on public roads without a person behind the wheel who can take control over the car if necessary.</p>
