        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>1920s</h2>
        <p>In 1925, Houdina Radio Control demonstrated the radio-controlled "American Wonder" on New York City streets, traveling up Broadway and down Fifth Avenue through the thick of the traffic jam.
        The American Wonder was a 1926 Chandler that was equipped with a transmitting antennae on the tonneau and was operated by a second car that followed it and sent out radio impulses which were caught by the transmitting antennae.</p>
        <h2>1950s</h2>
        <p>In 1953 the RCA Labs built a car which was guided by wires, which were laid in patterns at the laboratory.
        In 1957 a demonstration in Nebraska Highway 2 took place with the sam system at it sucessfully worked.</p>
        <h2>1960s</h2>
        <p>In 1960 the Ohio State University started a project to develop driverless cars which were actived by electronic devices imbedded in the roadway.
        During the 1960s the United Kingdom tested a driverless Citroen DS which interacts with magnetic cabels which were embedded in the road.
        It went through a test track at 80 miles per hour without deviation of speed or direction in any weather conditions, and in a far more effective way than by human control.</p>

        <h2>1980s</h2>
        <p>In the 1980s, a vision-guided Mercedes-Benz robotic van, designed by Ernst Dickmanns and his team at the Bundeswehr University Munich, achieved a speed of 39 mile per hour on streets without traffic.

        In 1987 HRL Laboratories demonstrated the first off-road map and sensor-based autonomous navigation on the ALV. The vehicle traveled over 2,000 feet at 1.9 miles per hour on complex terrain with steep slopes, ravines, large rocks, and vegetation.
        By 1989, Carnegie Mellon University had pioneered the use of neural networks to steer and otherwise control autonomous vehicles, forming the basis of contemporary control strategies.</p>
        <h2>1990s</h2>
        <p>In 1994, the twin robot vehicles VaMP and Vita-2 of Daimler-Benz and Ernst Dickmanns of UniBwM drove more than 620 miles on a Paris three-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at speeds up to 81 miles per hour,
        albeit semi-autonomously with human interventions. They demonstrated autonomous driving in free lanes, convoy driving, and lane changes with autonomous passing of other cars.
        That same year, Lucas Industries developed parts for a semi-autonomous car in a project that was funded by Jaguar Cars, Lucas, and the UK Department of Trade and Industry.
        In 1995, Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab project completed a 3,100 miles (5,000 km) cross-country journey, of which 98.2% was autonomously controlled, dubbed "No Hands Across America".</p>
